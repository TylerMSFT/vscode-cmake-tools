# Frequently Asked Questions — CMake Tools 1.4.0 documentation

## What About CMake Language Support?

CMake Tools was create separately from the [CMake extension][1], which provides language coloring and autocompletion support.

## I'm New to CMake. Help?

CMake Tools is not the same as CMake. There are many great resources around to learn how to use CMake. A good video introduction can be found in Jason Turner's [C++ Weekly - Intro to CMake][2].

[CMake's documentation][3] is also available.
