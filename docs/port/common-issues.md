# Common Issues and Resolutions — CMake Tools 1.4.0 documentation

There are a few frequently appearing issues in the CMake Tools issue tracker. Make sure you've checked that your issue isn't already solved here before submitting a question or bug report.

## I see green underlines/squiggles beneath my `#include` directives in my source files

## The "Debug" button and "Debug target" features are ignoring my `launch.json`

If you wish to specify additional debugging options, and/or use a different debugging engine, refer to [Debugging with CMake Tools and launch.json][1].

Note

The target debugging feature is restricted to launching target executables with a default configuration in cpptools' debugging engine.
