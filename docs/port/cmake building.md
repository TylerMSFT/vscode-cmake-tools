# CMake Building — CMake Tools 1.4.0 documentation

Once you have [configured][1] your project, you can run a CMake build. Most work with CMake Tools will be done with configuring, and the build process is much simpler.

Starting a build can be done in one of three ways:

1. Executing the _CMake: Build_ command

2. Hitting the associated hotkey (the default being F7).

3. Pressing the _Build_ button in the status bar.

When the build starts, the CMake Tools output panel will be opened and the output from the build tool will be shown as it runs. The _Build_ button will change to a _Stop_ button and may show a progress bar for the running build. Pressing the _Stop_ button will cancel the running build. Attempting to execute a build while a build is running will cancel the running build and start a new one.

Note

The progress bar will only be shown if the build tool emits output lines that can be parsed to contain a percentage of the build progress. This includes Ninja and Makefile generators. MSBuild does not emit this information, so no progress bar will be visible.

The results of the build will be written to the directory specified by [cmake.buildDirectory][2]. This defaults to a subdirectory of the project directory, so the build results will be visible within the project explorer. The exact file paths will depend on the CMake project configuration.

## The Default Target

CMake Tools persists a "default target" for the build process. The default target is the "all" target (named `ALL_BUILD` in some generators), which will build all targets CMake has designated for a default build.

The name of the default target is shown in the status bar to the right of the _Build_ button in square brackets:

Clicking this button will show a quick-pick for all the target CMake Tools is aware of that can be built, along with the full path to the build result that will be generated by the target:

## Building a Single Target

Instead of changing the build target, one can also request to build a single target a single time. Run the _CMake: Build a target_ command, or hit the associated hotkey (defaults to Shift+F7).

Note

CMake will build dependent targets, even if they aren't directly selected.

## Cleaning Up

CMake Tools lets you clean the build output by running the _CMake: Clean_ command. One can also run the _CMake: Clean rebuild_ to quickly delete build results and run the build from scratch.
