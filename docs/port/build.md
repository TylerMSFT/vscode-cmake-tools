# Build with CMake Tools

Once you have [configured](configure.md) your project, you can run a CMake build. Most of your time with CMake Tools will be spent configuring the build. The build process is much simpler.

You can start a build in one of three ways:

1. Run **CMake: Build** from the VS Code command pallette.
2. Pressing the associated hotkey (the default is **F7**).
3. Selecting the **Build** button in the VS Code status bar.

When the build starts, the CMake Tools output panel opens and the output from the build tool displays. The **Build** button will change to a **Stop** button and may show a progress bar for the running build. Pressing the *Stop* button cancels the running build. Trying to run a build while another build is running cancels the running build and starts a new one.

> [!NOTE]
>The progress bar only displays if the build tool emits output lines that can be parsed to contain a percentage of the build progress. This includes Ninja and Makefile generators. MSBuild does not emit this information, so no progress bar will be visible.

The results of the build are written to the directory specified by [cmake.buildDirectory](cmake-settigns.md). This defaults to a subdirectory of the project directory, so the build results are visible within the project explorer. The exact file paths will depend on your CMake project configuration.

## The Default Target

CMake Tools persists a "default target" for the build process. The default target is the "all" target (named `ALL_BUILD` in some generators), which builds all targets CMake has designated for a default build.

The name of the default target is shown in the status bar to the right of the **Build** button in square brackets:

Clicking this button will show a quick-pick for all the target CMake Tools is aware of that can be built, along with the full path to the build result that will be generated by the target:

## Building a Single Target

Instead of changing the build target, one can also request to build a single target a single time. Run the _CMake: Build a target_ command, or hit the associated hotkey (defaults to Shift+F7).

Note

CMake will build dependent targets, even if they aren't directly selected.

## Cleaning Up

CMake Tools lets you clean the build output by running the _CMake: Clean_ command. One can also run the _CMake: Clean rebuild_ to quickly delete build results and run the build from scratch.
